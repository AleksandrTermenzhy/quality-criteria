## How to use this guide

This guide is separated into several sections, grouped by common rules context(e.g. basics, classes, architecture, design etc.). Each section has a unique prefix for easier navigation. These sections are:
- *B* - [Base](./base.md). Contains general programming best-practices that can be applied not only to Java;
- *CODE* - [Code style](./code.md). Contains general and Java-specific code formatting best practices;
- *FUNC* - [Function](./function.md). Contains best-practices and tactical patterns to apply when designing functions/methods;
- *CLS* - [Class](./class.md'>Class). Contains generic OOP best-practices and Java-specific rules;
- *ARCH* - [Architecture](./architecture.md). Contains generic architecture implementation advices;
- *SEC* - [Security](./security.md). Generic and Java-specific security-related advices;
- *MISC* - [Miscellaneous](./misc.md). Performance, UX, monitoring and other best practices, but are out of scope of this;

Mandatory rules are prefixed with *M*, e.g. *M-CLS-5* is a mandatory rule #5 from Class section, while *MISC-3* is an optional rule from Miscellaneous section.
